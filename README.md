Bering Glacier Monitoring and Glacier Ablation Sensor System Website

This is the complete website source code for the Glacier Ablation Sensor System (GASS) website.
GASS is custom hardware deployed by the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) to monitor glacial ablation.
The website features live syndication of the remotely telemetered meteorology and ablation data from the Bering Glacier, where GASS was deployed from 2010-2012.
